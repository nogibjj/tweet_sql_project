# tweet_sql_project
This project aims to use twitter data to understand whether President Joe Biden's approval rating has anything to do with how many retweets he gets on twitter in a given day. I used Tweepy to collect the data from Twitter and SQLite to construct and populate a database, where I conduct further data analysis.
