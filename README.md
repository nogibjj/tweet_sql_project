# SQL with Biden's Tweets
This project aims to use twitter data to understand whether President Joe Biden's approval rating has anything to do with how many retweets he gets on twitter in a given day. I used Tweepy to collect the data from Twitter and SQLite to construct and populate a database, where I conduct further data analysis. 

Here is a project schema:

## Bash CLI tool to scrape and transform Twitter Data

For the first part of this project, I built a Click command line tool to scrape Twitter data by giving it a user name. 
For textual analysis and sentiment analysis, Twitter data is fundamental in important ways. 

Note: In order to run the extract_tweets.py script, you have the option to run
```
python scripts/extract_tweets.py -n @twitter_handle
```

Or give the script execution permission directly:

```
chmod +x scripts/extract_tweets.py
./scripts/extract_tweets.py -n @twitter_handle
```

### Twitter Authentication and Data Scraping

I used GitHub Code Space's builtin secrets option to add my Twitter API key, secret, access token, and access token secret. The extract.py script is a Click application that authenticates to Twitter using these API authentifications and retrieves the most recent tweets from the handle that is inputed by the user. 

### Constructing SQLite Database

In the tweet_to_sql.py script, I created a database called biden_tweets.db and established a connection to it in SQLite. I created two tables, one for the tweet data collected from the Tweepy API and another for Biden's approval rating, which is sourced from FiveThirtyEight's aggregated tracker.

I specified the fields required to create the tables and populated them with the csvs from the data folder.

### Research Questions

Note: to replicate this analysis, please execute the scripts in the following order

```
# Extract the Twitter data into the data directory
python scripts/extract_tweets.py -n @JoeBiden

# Set up SQLite Database and populate it with data
python tweets_to_sql.py

# Run the queries
python query_tweets.py
```

We want to understand whether Joe Biden's approval ratings were high when his twitter retweet counts were also high. Int he query_tweets.py file, I wrote 5 queries to help us answer this question. First note that our tweepy API only allowed us to collect the first 200 tweets from his timeline, so we had to limit our analysis to September, October and November data. 

Our first query gives us the 10 days with his highest approval ratings: note that most of them were in October.

Our second query gives us the 10 days where his twitter retweet counts were the highest: they were sporadically distributed from September to November.

We then get Joe Biden's mean approval rating: 46.14% (spoilers, he's really underperforming this average) and his mean retweet count: 21650. 

Our final query then merges the the approval rating table and the twitter data table and selects the 10 days when Biden had the highest approval ratings. His retween counts were around average, ranging from a low of 7955 to a high of 36942. Therefore we cannot say that there's a relationship between Biden's high approval rating and high tweet count.
